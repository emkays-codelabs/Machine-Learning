## 1️⃣ What is Machine Learning?

**Machine Learning (ML)** is a way of teaching computers to **learn patterns from data** instead of writing hard‑coded rules.

### Traditional Programming

```
Rules + Data → Output
```

### Machine Learning

```
Data + Correct Answers → Rules (Model)
```

📌 Instead of saying:

> IF salary > 50,000 → approve loan

We say:

> Here is past loan data. Learn the decision rule yourself.

---

## 2️⃣ Types of Machine Learning

Machine Learning is divided into **three main categories**.

---

### 🔹 2.1 Supervised Learning

✔ Data contains:

* **Input (X)** → features
* **Output (Y)** → correct answers

#### Example Dataset

| Hours Studied (X) | Marks (Y) |
| ----------------- | --------- |
| 2                 | 40        |
| 4                 | 60        |
| 6                 | 80        |

📌 Used when the correct output is known.

Common algorithms:

* Linear Regression
* Logistic Regression
* Decision Trees

---

### 🔹 2.2 Unsupervised Learning

✔ Only **input (X)** is given
✔ No correct answers

Examples:

* Customer clustering
* Image grouping

Algorithms:

* K‑Means
* PCA

---

### 🔹 2.3 Semi‑Supervised Learning

✔ Small labeled dataset
✔ Large unlabeled dataset

Example:

* Medical image analysis

---

## 3️⃣ What is Supervised Learning?

Supervised learning learns a function:

```
Y = f(X)
```

Meaning:

* Given **X**, predict **Y**
* Learn by comparing prediction with truth

---

## 4️⃣ Regression vs Classification

### 🔹 Regression

✔ Output is a **continuous number**

Examples:

* House price → ₹35,00,000
* Temperature → 30.5°C
* Salary → ₹80,000

Algorithm:

* **Linear Regression**

---

### 🔹 Classification

✔ Output is a **category**

Examples:

* Spam / Not Spam
* Pass / Fail

Algorithms:

* Logistic Regression
* Decision Trees

---

## 5️⃣ What is Linear Regression?

**Linear Regression** is a **supervised regression algorithm**.

Assumption:

> Output changes **linearly** with input.

---

## 6️⃣ Equation of a Line (Model)

From mathematics:

```
y = mx + c
```

In Machine Learning notation:

```
ŷ = w·x + b
```

Where:

* `x` → input feature
* `ŷ` → predicted output
* `m / w` → slope (weight)
* `c / b` → intercept (bias)

---

## 7️⃣ Best Fitted Line — Intuition

Many lines can pass through data.

The **best fitted line**:

* Is closest to all points
* Minimizes total error

📌 ML’s job:

> Find best **m** and **c** values

---

## 8️⃣ Error / Loss Function

Loss measures **how wrong** the model is.

### Mean Squared Error (MSE)

```
MSE = (1/n) Σ (y − ŷ)²
```

Why squared?

* Removes negative sign
* Penalizes large mistakes
* Smooth curve → easy optimization

---

## 9️⃣ Why Gradient Descent?

We need best **m** and **c**.

Trying all values is impossible.

✔ **Gradient Descent** efficiently finds them.

---

## 🔄 10️⃣ How Gradient Descent Works

1. Start with random `m` and `c`
2. Predict outputs
3. Compute error
4. Find direction of maximum error increase
5. Move in opposite direction
6. Repeat until minimum

📌 Like walking downhill to the lowest point.

---

## 1️⃣1️⃣ Learning Rate (η)

Controls step size.

* Too small → slow learning
* Too large → unstable

Update rule:

```
new = old − η × gradient
```

---

## 1️⃣2️⃣ Why Chain Rule is Required

Error depends on:

```
Error → Prediction → m, c
```

Chain rule connects these dependencies mathematically.

---

## 1️⃣3️⃣ Full Derivation of MSE w.r.t **m** (Slope)

### Step 1: Write MSE

```
MSE = (1/n) Σ (y − ŷ)²
```

Substitute `ŷ = mx + c`:

```
MSE = (1/n) Σ (y − m x − c)²
```

---

### Step 2: Differentiate w.r.t m

```
∂/∂m (y − m x − c)²
```

Apply chain rule:

```
2(y − m x − c) · ∂/∂m(y − m x − c)
```

---

### Step 3: Inner derivative

```
∂/∂m (y − m x − c) = −x
```

---

### Step 4: Combine

```
∂MSE/∂m = (1/n) Σ 2(y − m x − c)(−x)
```

Simplify:

```
∂MSE/∂m = −(2/n) Σ x(y − ŷ)
```

---

## 1️⃣4️⃣ Full Derivation of MSE w.r.t **c** (Intercept)

### Step 1: Start from MSE

```
MSE = (1/n) Σ (y − m x − c)²
```

---

### Step 2: Differentiate w.r.t c

```
∂/∂c (y − m x − c)²
```

Apply chain rule:

```
2(y − m x − c) · ∂/∂c(y − m x − c)
```

---

### Step 3: Inner derivative

```
∂/∂c (y − m x − c) = −1
```

---

### Step 4: Combine

```
∂MSE/∂c = (1/n) Σ 2(y − m x − c)(−1)
```

Simplify:

```
∂MSE/∂c = −(2/n) Σ (y − ŷ)
```

---

## 1️⃣5️⃣ Gradient Descent Update Rules

```
m = m − η · ∂MSE/∂m
c = c − η · ∂MSE/∂c
```

---

## 1️⃣6️⃣ Visual Intuition (ASCII)

### Best Fit Line

```
•      •
   •       •
------ best line -----
```

### Error Curve

```
      /
     /   minimum
____/____\____
```

---

## 1️⃣7️⃣ Key Takeaways

✔ ML learns from data
✔ Supervised learning uses labeled data
✔ Linear regression predicts numbers
✔ MSE measures error
✔ Gradient descent minimizes error
✔ Learning rate controls speed

# 🔑 Extra Key Points to Note in Linear Regression

## 1️⃣ Assumptions of Linear Regression (VERY IMPORTANT)

Linear Regression **works well only if these are roughly true**:

1. **Linearity**
   Relationship between X and Y is linear
   (Straight-line trend)

2. **Independence**
   Data points are independent of each other

3. **Homoscedasticity**
   Error variance is constant
   (Errors don’t grow with X)

4. **No Multicollinearity** (for multiple features)
   Features should not be highly correlated

5. **Errors are Normally Distributed** (mostly for inference)

📌 **Exam tip:**

> Violating assumptions → poor predictions

---

## 2️⃣ Feature Scaling Matters (for Gradient Descent)

* Gradient descent is **slow** if features have different scales

Example:

```
Age: 0–100
Salary: 10,000–1,000,000
```

✔ Solution:

* Standardization
* Normalization

📌 Scaling **does NOT change the line**, only training speed.

---

## 3️⃣ Closed-Form Solution vs Gradient Descent

### Normal Equation

```
θ = (XᵀX)⁻¹Xᵀy
```

✔ No learning rate
✔ No iterations
❌ Slow for large datasets

### Gradient Descent

✔ Works for huge data
✔ Flexible
❌ Needs tuning (η)

📌 ML uses **gradient descent**, stats often uses **normal equation**.

---

## 4️⃣ Bias–Variance Tradeoff (Simple Intuition)

* **High Bias** → underfitting (too simple)
* **High Variance** → overfitting (too complex)

Linear regression usually has:
✔ Low variance
❌ Can have high bias

---

## 5️⃣ Overfitting Can Still Happen

Even linear models can overfit when:

* Too many features
* Small dataset

✔ Solution:

* Regularization (L1 / L2)

---

## 6️⃣ Regularization (Very Important Concept)

### Ridge Regression (L2)

```
Loss = MSE + λ Σ m²
```

✔ Shrinks weights
✔ Reduces overfitting

### Lasso Regression (L1)

```
Loss = MSE + λ Σ |m|
```

✔ Can set weights to zero
✔ Feature selection

---

## 7️⃣ Interpretation of Parameters (Big Advantage!)

Linear regression is **interpretable**:

* `m = 5` →
  “For 1 unit increase in X, Y increases by 5 units”

* `c` →
  Value of Y when X = 0

📌 This is why it’s used in economics & science.

---

## 8️⃣ Evaluation Metrics (Besides MSE)

* **MAE** – Mean Absolute Error
* **RMSE** – Root Mean Squared Error
* **R² Score** – Explained variance

📌 R² close to **1** = good fit

---

## 9️⃣ When NOT to Use Linear Regression

❌ Strongly non-linear relationship
❌ Complex interactions
❌ Categorical output

Use instead:

* Polynomial regression
* Trees
* Neural networks

---

## 🔟 Interview One-Liners (Gold)

* “Linear regression minimizes squared error”
* “Gradient descent finds optimal parameters”
* “Learning rate controls convergence”
* “MSE is convex → global minimum”
* “Regularization prevents overfitting”

## 🧠 Mental Model (Remember This)

> **Linear Regression = Draw the best straight line by minimizing error**
