## 1️⃣ What is Machine Learning?

**Machine Learning (ML)** teaches computers to **learn patterns from data** instead of following hand‑written rules.

### Traditional Programming

```
Rules + Data → Output
```

### Machine Learning

```
Data + Correct Answers → Rules (Model)
```

📌 Instead of explicitly coding logic, we let the computer **discover the rule**.

---

## 2️⃣ Types of Machine Learning

### 🔹 Supervised Learning

* Input **X** and correct output **Y** are given
* Goal: learn a function

```
Y = f(X)
```

Examples:

* Linear Regression
* Logistic Regression
* Decision Trees

---

### 🔹 Unsupervised Learning

* Only **X** is given
* No labels

Examples:

* K‑Means Clustering
* PCA

---

### 🔹 Semi‑Supervised Learning

* Small labeled data
* Large unlabeled data

Used in:

* Medical imaging
* Speech recognition

---

## 3️⃣ What is Supervised Learning?

Supervised learning works by:

1. Making a prediction
2. Comparing with true output
3. Reducing the error

📌 Learning happens by **minimizing error**.

---

## 4️⃣ Regression vs Classification

### 🔹 Regression

* Output is **continuous**

Examples:

* House price
* Salary
* Temperature

---

### 🔹 Classification

* Output is **categorical**

Examples:

* Spam / Not Spam
* Pass / Fail

---

## 5️⃣ What is Linear Regression?

**Linear Regression** is a supervised regression algorithm that assumes:

> Output changes **linearly** with input

---

## 6️⃣ Equation of a Line (Model)

### From Mathematics

```
y = mx + c
```

### In Machine Learning

```
ŷ = wx + b
```

Where:

* `x` → input feature
* `y` → true output
* `ŷ` → predicted output
* `m / w` → slope (controls tilt)
* `c / b` → intercept (moves line up/down)

---

## 7️⃣ Intuition: Best Fitted Line

Many lines can fit the data.

The **best line** is the one that:

* Is closest to all points
* Minimizes total error

📌 ML’s job is to find the **best m and c**.

---

## 8️⃣ Error, Residual, and Loss

### Residual (Error for one point)

```
Errorᵢ = yᵢ − ŷᵢ
```

* Perfect prediction → error = 0

---

## 9️⃣ Mean Squared Error (MSE)

We care about **all points**, not just one.

```
MSE = (1/n) Σ (y − ŷ)²
```

### Why square the error?

* Removes negative sign
* Penalizes large errors more
* Makes loss smooth and convex

### Substitute the model

```
MSE(m, c) = (1/n) Σ (y − mx − c)²
```

---

## 🔟 Why Gradient Descent is Needed

Trying all values of `m` and `c` is impossible.

✔ Loss curve is convex
✔ Gradient Descent efficiently finds the minimum

---

## 1️⃣1️⃣ What is a Gradient?

**Gradient = direction of steepest increase of error**.

To minimize error:

> Move in the **opposite direction** of the gradient

---

## 1️⃣2️⃣ Learning Rate (η)

Controls step size.

```
new_value = old_value − η × gradient
```

* Too small → slow
* Too large → unstable

---

## 1️⃣3️⃣ Why Chain Rule is Required

Loss depends on parameters indirectly:

```
Loss → Prediction → m, c
```

Chain rule connects these dependencies.

---

## 1️⃣4️⃣ Full Derivation: MSE w.r.t. Slope (m)

### Step 1: Write MSE

```
MSE = (1/n) Σ (y − mx − c)²
```

### Step 2: Differentiate w.r.t m

```
∂/∂m (y − mx − c)²
```

Apply chain rule:

```
2(y − mx − c) · ∂/∂m(y − mx − c)
```

### Step 3: Inner derivative

```
∂/∂m(y − mx − c) = −x
```

### Step 4: Combine

```
∂MSE/∂m = (1/n) Σ 2(y − mx − c)(−x)
```

### Step 5: Simplify

```
∂MSE/∂m = −(2/n) Σ x(y − ŷ)
```

🧠 **Intuition**

* Error × input
* Large `x` → larger effect on slope

---

## 1️⃣5️⃣ Full Derivation: MSE w.r.t. Intercept (c)

### Step 1: Start with MSE

```
MSE = (1/n) Σ (y − mx − c)²
```

### Step 2: Differentiate w.r.t c

```
∂/∂c (y − mx − c)²
```

Apply chain rule:

```
2(y − mx − c) · ∂/∂c(y − mx − c)
```

### Step 3: Inner derivative

```
∂/∂c(y − mx − c) = −1
```

### Step 4: Simplify

```
∂MSE/∂c = −(2/n) Σ (y − ŷ)
```

🧠 **Intuition**

* Depends on average error
* Shifts line up/down

---

## 1️⃣6️⃣ Gradient Descent Update Rules

```
m = m − η · ∂MSE/∂m
c = c − η · ∂MSE/∂c
```

---

## 1️⃣7️⃣ Visual Intuition (ASCII)

### Best Fit Line

```
•      •
   •       •
------ best line -----
```

### Error Curve

```
      /
     /   minimum
____/____\____
```

---

## 1️⃣8️⃣ Assumptions of Linear Regression

1. Linearity
2. Independence
3. Homoscedasticity
4. No multicollinearity
5. Normally distributed errors

---

## 1️⃣9️⃣ Feature Scaling

* Speeds up gradient descent
* Does **not** change fitted line

Methods:

* Standardization
* Normalization

---

## 2️⃣0️⃣ Regularization

### Ridge (L2)

```
Loss = MSE + λ Σ m²
```

### Lasso (L1)

```
Loss = MSE + λ Σ |m|
```

---

## 2️⃣1️⃣ Closed‑Form vs Gradient Descent

### Normal Equation

```
θ = (XᵀX)⁻¹Xᵀy
```

✔ Exact solution
❌ Slow for large data

---

## 2️⃣2️⃣ Bias–Variance Tradeoff

* High bias → underfitting
* High variance → overfitting

Linear regression:
✔ Low variance
❌ Can have high bias

---

## 2️⃣3️⃣ Evaluation Metrics

* MAE
* MSE
* RMSE
* R² Score

---

## 2️⃣4️⃣ When NOT to Use Linear Regression

❌ Strong non‑linearity
❌ Complex interactions
❌ Categorical output

---

## 2️⃣5️⃣ Interview & Exam One‑Liners

* “Linear regression minimizes squared error”
* “Gradient descent finds optimal parameters”
* “Learning rate controls convergence”
* “MSE is convex → global minimum”
